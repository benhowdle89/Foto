# Foto

Foto is a simple HTML/CSS template for kickstarting a project or just learning.

It has a sprinkle of PHP here and there to aid the structure of it and a small bit of JavaScript for the homepage slideshow.

[See it in action](http://twostepmedia.co.uk/foto/).

## Instructions

A ".htaccess" file is in place for "pretty URLs", ie. if you place an "about.php" file in the root of the site and put a link to "/about/" it will route through to your "about.php" file.

The CSS is split out to a certain point, ie. Typography, Colour and Layout etcâ€¦

There is an "includes" folder with a "header.php" and "footer.php" file in there, you'll see in the individual page files how to call these two includes.

There is a link to Google's CDN jQuery file and a Google Web Font link for your convenience.

All of the user images, ie. the one in the footer, are driven by Twitter's Avatar API, which follow this structure: https://api.twitter.com/1/users/profile_image?screen_name=benhowdle&size=original

's' folder holds the stylesheets

'i' folder holds the site images

'j' folder holds the JavaScript files


### Other notes

When doing these boilerplates and templates it's hard to know how much to include, so if you feel it could have more or be more commented, please let me know: [@benhowdle](http://twitter.com/benhowdle)
