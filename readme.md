# Foto

Foto is a simple HTML/CSS template for kickstarting a project or just learning.

It has a sprinkle of PHP here and there to aid the structure of it and a small bit of JavaScript for the homepage slideshow.

## Instructions

A ".htaccess" file is in place for "pretty URLs", ie. if you place an "about.php" file in the root of the site and put a link to "/about/" it will route through to your "about.php" file.

The CSS is split out to a certain point, ie. Typography, Colour and Layout etcâ€¦

There is an "includes" folder with a "header.php" and "footer.php" file in there, you'll see in the individual page files how to call these two includes.
